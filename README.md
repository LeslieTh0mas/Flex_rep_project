  At my current employer, I am an operations trainer. The way operations is organized, there are four main groups. Each of those main groups, has a set number of employees spanning across two bi-coastal campuses along with two managers, two work leads, and one operations trainer. There is also a team that consists of six flex reps that can process some work for each group. When an associate calls in sick, or volumes are high in a particular group, the managers are able to request help from a member of the flex team. It is impossible for managers to keep up with what these flex reps are able to process.
  I am creating a program for the two managers I support where they could type in the flex reps name, to see what functions they would be able to help us out in. The managers are also able to search by trainer to see stats on associates they have trained.
